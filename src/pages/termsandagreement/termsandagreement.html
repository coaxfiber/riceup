		Perhaps the most important section of this legal document is the section that addresses how a user should use (or not use) your website and app.<br><br>

In the Terms and Conditions of Spotify above, the “User Guidelines” section highlights a number of restricted user actions, including forbidding a user from:<br><br>

Using the Spotify Service to import or copy and local files you do not have the legal right to import or copy in this way
Circumventing any territorial restrictions applied by Spotify or its licensors
Selling a user account or playlist, or otherwise accepting compensation, financial or otherwise, to influence the name of an account or playlist or the content included on an account or playlist
